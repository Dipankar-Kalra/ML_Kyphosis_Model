# ML_Kyphosis_Model
Machine Learning for Kyphosis Disease Classification

About Kyphosis:
Kyphosis is an excessive forward curvature of the spine that affects between 1 in 200 adolescents in the USA each year, and if left unaddressed can lead to pain and postural issues.

The Data:
The data (kyphosis.csv) has 810K rows and 4 columns, representing data on children who have had corrective spinal surgery. Data set contains 3 inputs and 1 output. 

Inputs:
1. Age:in months
2. Number: the number of verterbrae involved
3. Start: the number of the first(topmost) veterbra operated on

Outputs:
Kyphosis: a factor with levels 'absent' or 'present' indicating if a Kyphosis (a type of deformation) was present after the surgery.

Goal:
Using machine learning to predict surgical outcomes and help physicians plan more effective interventions.
